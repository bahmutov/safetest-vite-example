# safetest-vs-cypress

> The same React component tests using SafeTest vs Cypress Component testing

📝 Read the blog post [Cypress Vs SafeTest
](https://glebbahmutov.com/blog/cypress-vs-safetest/)

- [safetest-example](./safetest-example/) folder has the default SafeTest tests from [kolodny/safetest](https://github.com/kolodny/safetest) as a standalone project.
- [cypress-example](./cypress-example/) folder has the same tests plus many more rewritten using [Cypress component testing](https://glebbahmutov.com/blog/how-cypress-component-testing-was-born/)
